Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like tuna can absolutely go with red wine. A Rosé will also pair nicely, particularly if your tunan is prepared with ingredients better suited to a white wine. One wine you could try is Pepper Bridge Winery Merlot (). It has 4.4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 28 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":444612,"title":"Pepper Bridge Winery Merlot ()","description":"Our 2011 Merlot is rich, round, and intricately layered. An earthy bouquet of cherry and wild berries dance on the nose of this wine, backed by a floral summer breeze. Hints of violets, roasted coffee, spices and mineral weave through the palate.
